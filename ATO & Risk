üìú Step 5: Authorization Overview

The Authorization phase of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) is the formal process of evaluating a system‚Äôs security
posture and determining whether it is approved to operate. This decision is made by a senior leader known as the Authorizing Official (AO) 
based on a thorough review of RMF documentation and risk exposure.

üõ°Ô∏è Purpose of Authorization

Authorization ensures that:

All security controls have been selected, implemented, and tested

Any remaining risks are clearly documented and acknowledged

The system meets organizational and federal security requirements

This step shifts responsibility for the system‚Äôs risk from the technical teams to senior leadership, ensuring transparency and accountability.

üîó How Authorization Ties into the Project


Deliverable	                            Role in Authorization

System Security Plan (SSP)	            Describes how security controls are implemented
Security Assessment Report (SAR)	      Documents the results of control testing and identifies gaps
Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)	  Lists issues and tracks remediation timelines
Authorization Decision Memo (ATO)	      Official sign-off granting system operation approval

‚úÖ Outcome
The result of this phase is an Authorization to Operate (ATO) decision, which allows the system to be used in a production environment. 
This decision may include conditions or timelines for fixing outstanding issues. In this project, an ATO decision is simulated based on the documented controls and assessment results.

## Summary

After reviewing the following Risk Management Framework (RMF) artifacts:

- **System Security Plan (SSP)** ‚Äì documents security control implementation
- **Security Assessment Report (SAR)** ‚Äì summarizes control testing results
- **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)** ‚Äì tracks any remediation efforts

I authorize the Global Automotive ERP system to operate in a production environment.

---

## Conditions of Authorization

The following conditions are in place for this authorization:

- Identified **partially compliant controls (AC-2, CM-6)** must be remediated within **90 days**
- Ongoing **monitoring and risk assessments** must be conducted quarterly
- Any **significant changes** to the system must trigger a reauthorization review

---

## Residual Risk Acceptance

The residual risks identified in the SAR have been reviewed and accepted. Risk levels are considered manageable based on the following:

- Implementation of strong foundational controls (IA-2, AU-6, IR-4, SI-2)
- Plans in place to address medium-risk findings
- Continuous monitoring procedures established
