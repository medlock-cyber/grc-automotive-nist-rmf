FIPS 199 & 200 is essential for appying the NIST RMF effectively. 

FIPS 199 helps you determine the impact level for the three security objectives (CIA Triad).

*Remember this*

Confidientiality = prevting unauthorized disclosure of information
Integrity = preventing unauthorized modification or destruction
Availability = ensuring timely and reliable access to information

Essentially, you are answering the question, "if this system's data was leaked, changed, or taken offline, how bad would it be for the organization?"

The Impact levels of FIPS 199 are pretty straight forward; Low, Moderate, & High.

Low = Minor inconvenience or limited effect
Moderate = Serious damage to operationg, finances or reputation
High = Severe/Catastrophic harm to mission, finance or national security

FIPS 200 tells you what general control areas you must address in your system based on its categories from FIPS 199.

Think of it as the security control shopping list for every federal system, telling you the 17 control familiies needed to implement from NIST SP 800-53
