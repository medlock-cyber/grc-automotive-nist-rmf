üß† Why Continuous Monitoring Is Important

Continuous Monitoring is critical because security is not static ‚Äî threats, systems, users, and risks 
are constantly changing. Even after you've built and authorized a secure system,
vulnerabilities can emerge through:

> New software patches or misconfigurations
> Insider threats or account misuse
> Changes in compliance requirements
> Vendor or third-party updates
> Evolving threat actor tactics

üîê ConMon Ensures That:

Benefit	                         What It Means
‚úÖ Ongoing Compliance	           Proves your system continues to meet NIST or federal security standards
üß™ Control Effectiveness	       Verifies that controls work as intended over time
üîç Risk Detection	               Identifies new vulnerabilities or attack paths quickly
üìâ Risk Reduction	               Enables faster mitigation and lower impact from security events
üìä Visibility	                   Keeps stakeholders aware of current risk posture and trends


ConMon (Continuous Monitoring) starts immediately after step 5 (Authorization). The ATO gives you permission to operate
and ConMon ensures you're still operating securely. It pulls from what I've already built; Controls from your SSP, Findings from your SAR,
Risks accepted in your ATO, Fixes tracked in your POA&M. It then monitors those areas using
Technical tools (SIEM, scanners, logs), Administrative processes (access reviews, policy updates), 
and Reporting cycles (Monthly/Quarterly reports) 

üß± First Steps in Continuous Monitoring:

‚úÖ Identify what controls need to be monitored (based on risk)
üîÅ Define how often to review/test each one
üìä Establish metrics or thresholds (e.g., patch in 7 days, log reviews weekly)
üõ†Ô∏è Choose tools (SIEM, vulnerability scanner, GRC platform)
üßæ Begin logging findings and trends

##Here is a Mock Continous Monitoring Plan##

üîÅ Continuous Monitoring ‚Äì Overview

**Continuous Monitoring (ConMon)** is the final step in the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). 
It involves the ongoing observation, assessment, and reporting of a system‚Äôs security posture to ensure that implemented controls continue to be effective over time.

This step is essential for:
- Detecting new threats and vulnerabilities
- Monitoring compliance with security baselines
- Tracking changes and their impact on security
- Maintaining visibility into operational risk

ConMon supports decision-makers by providing real-time or near-real-time data that informs risk responses and corrective actions.
It is a foundational practice for long-term security assurance and system integrity.
