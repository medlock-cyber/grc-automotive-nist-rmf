Raw Notes

The Big Picture of SP 800-53

This Special Publication is the authoritatative catalog for security and privacy controls for US Federal Systems. The question that needs to be answered is "What specific protections does this system need and how should I apply them?"

| Component                | What It Does                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Control ID**           | e.g., `AC-2` (Access Control 2: Account Management)                               |
| **Control Name**         | Short description of what it governs                                              |
| **Control Statement**    | A clear, mandatory requirement (e.g., "The organization manages system accounts") |
| **Control Enhancements** | Optional add-ons for higher assurance (e.g., automate account removals)           |
| **Discussion**           | NIST's explanation of what the control means                                      |
| **References**           | Links to related controls and guidance                                            |

*Remember this*

This ties into FIPS 199 by the way you categorized your system based on how bad it would be if:
Its data was stolen (Confidentiality)
its data was changed (Integrity)
It went offline (Availability)

This would essentially result in a High Impact system.

This ties into the FIPS 200 because I learned that 
there are 17 control families
you must apply controls from all of them
the depth of the controls depends on your FIPS 199 rating (Low/Mod/High)

For FIPS, When it says that you must apply all controls from all control families, thsi means that you are respsonsible for reviewing and addressing every relevant control within each of the 20 SP 800-53 control families based on the systems impact level.

You are not required to implement every single conrol in the catalog blindly. There 1000+ controls

Apply this baseline instead 
Low-Impact System → apply ~150 core controls

Moderate-Impact System → ~260 controls

High-Impact System → ~320+ controls
These are the required controls across the families.

Then you:

Tailor controls (add/remove/justify)

Implement what applies to your environment

Document how you meet or mitigate each one
