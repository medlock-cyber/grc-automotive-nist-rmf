Raw Notes

The Big Picture of SP 800-53

This Special Publication is the authoritatative catalog for security and privacy controls for US Federal Systems. 
[]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The question that needs to be answered is "What specific protections does this system need and how should I apply them?"

| Component                | What It Does                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Control ID**           | e.g., `AC-2` (Access Control 2: Account Management)                               |
| **Control Name**         | Short description of what it governs                                              |
| **Control Statement**    | A clear, mandatory requirement (e.g., "The organization manages system accounts") |
| **Control Enhancements** | Optional add-ons for higher assurance (e.g., automate account removals)           |
| **Discussion**           | NIST's explanation of what the control means                                      |
| **References**           | Links to related controls and guidance                                            |

*Remember this*

This ties into FIPS 199 by the way you categorized your system based on how bad it would be if:
Its data was stolen (Confidentiality)
its data was changed (Integrity)
It went offline (Availability)

This would essentially result in a High Impact system.

This ties into the FIPS 200 because I learned that 
there are 17 control families
you must apply controls from all of them
the depth of the controls depends on your FIPS 199 rating (Low/Mod/High)

For FIPS, When it says that you must apply all controls from all control families, 
this means that you are respsonsible for reviewing and addressing every relevant control within each of 
the 20 SP 800-53 control families based on the systems impact level.

You are not required to implement every single conrol in the catalog blindly. There 1000+ controls

Apply this baseline instead 
Low-Impact System → apply ~150 core controls

Moderate-Impact System → ~260 controls

High-Impact System → ~320+ controls
These are the required controls across the families.

Then you:

Tailor controls (add/remove/justify)

Implement what applies to your environment

Document how you meet or mitigate each one

The System is a Global Automative Manufacturing ERP with a HIGH impact level. The numbers after the controls *AC-2(3)* are enhancements
that help tailor the level of protection based on the impact of the system (From FIPS 199). Think of them as security hardening optiosn built
on the main control.

*Example*
- AC-2 = The System must manage user accounts, including creation, changes, and termination. This means that in the system above:
accounts are provisioned via Active Directory Integration
deactivation is triggeres automaticall after 30 days of inactivity
privelged access requires ISO approval (which prevents unatorized access and orphan accounts).
