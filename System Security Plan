Implementing Security Controls

Describe how to apply and enforce each selected cotrol in the system.

Take the selected SP 800-53 controls and write how each control is implemented, whos responsible, which systems or tools are involved,
and evidence that shows its in place (Logs, procedurs, screenshots).

This would make the SSP (System Security Plan)

SSP Example

### Control ID: AC-2 â€“ Account Management
**Control Description:** The organization manages information system accounts, 
including account creation, modification, disabling, and termination.

**Implementation:**
- Account requests are submitted through the internal Identity Governance system (SailPoint).
- All privileged access must be approved by the Information Security Officer (ISO).
- Inactive accounts are automatically disabled after 30 days using PowerShell scripts and GPO policies.
- Monthly account audits are conducted by the GRC team.

**Responsible Party:** System Administrator & GRC Analyst  
**Artifacts:** Access control policy, AD account list, audit logs

This would be consistent for the other 10-20 controls.
