The Security Assesment Plan summarizes the results of testing and evaluating the security controls of an information system.
Are the controls implemented correctly?
Are they operating as intended?
Do they meet security requirements?

These are questions that I ask myself when going through this step. The SAR is useful because its evidence based. It proves that your system isn't just "secure on paper". It has been tested
to highlight gaps, misconfigurations, or non-compliant controls. Doing this helps the authorizing official decide if the system is safe to operate thus improving security posture. 

I would use this during a cybersecurity audit because the SAR shows what needs fixing and what was tested. In GRC roles, its one of the most reviewed artifacts before a system goes live or gets authorized.
Below is a Mock SAR I created for this project

Here is a summary of what I just did;

The security assessment report is a key deliverable that documents the results of a formal security control assessment conducted on a simualted high-impact Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.
This report of a larger RMF-based cybersecurity project that aligns with NIST Special Publication 800-37 and 800-53 (Rev. 5). The SAR focuses on 10 high-priority controls selected form across all 
NIST control families, including access control, incident response, vulnerability remediation, and backup management. For each control, the SAR includes:
Assessment Methodology: How the control was tested (e.g., log review, configuration validation, script output, interviews)

Assessment Results: A summary of what was observed during testing

Compliance Status: Whether the control is compliant, partially compliant, or non-compliant

Risk Level: A risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) based on the potential impact of control weaknesses

Recommendations: Actions needed to remediate gaps or strengthen implementation

Supporting Artifacts: Sample scripts, screenshots, logs, or documentation used as evidence

This report demonstrates the assessor's ability to performs technical and procedural verification of security controls and generate risk-informed findings.it is a critical component used to supprt the system's 
Authorization to Operate (ATO) decision, as it infroms stakeholders of the current security posture and any outstanding vulnerabiities. By producing this SAR, the project calidates both cybersecurity knowledge and 
the ability to apply GRC processes in a simulated enterprise environment, making it a strong protfolio piece for risk analytics, ISSOs or RMF professionals.
